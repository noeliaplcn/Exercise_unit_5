The first literary European version of the story was published in Italy by Giambattista Basile in his Pentamerone in 1634; the version that is now most widely known in the English-speaking world was published in French by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps pass√© in 1697.Another version was later published by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection Grimms' Fairy Tales in 1812.
